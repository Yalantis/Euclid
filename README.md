#Note

depends on <a href="https://github.com/ozodrukh">Ozodrukh's</a> animation util for CircularReveal animation

#Usage

At the moment, it's just an example of implementation of above interface in your android project.
On later stages we are planning to create highly customisable library for good-looking interface.

But, if you want to use it in your project, you need to:

1. Include the library as local library project.
2. add this to your projects build.gradle file:<br>
   ```groovy
   	repositories {
   	    maven {
   	        url "https://jitpack.io"
   	    }
   	}

   ```
   <br> for CircularReveal module

3. Extend you activity from EuclidActivity
4. Implement getAdapter() method, so you return your own data.

*For a working implementation, Have a look at the Sample Project - sample*

#Customization

You can override several methods to adjust animation durations or radius of circle that
reveals the avatar.

#### Let us know!

We’d be really happy if you sent us links to your projects where you use our component. Just send an email to github@yalantis.com And do let us know if you have any questions or suggestion regarding the animation. 

P.S. We’re going to publish more awesomeness wrapped in code and a tutorial on how to make UI for Android (iOS) better than better. Stay tuned!
